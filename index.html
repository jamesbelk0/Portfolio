                <p>
                    My name is James Belk and I am just starting my coding career. I currently run a gym called Chair
                    City
                    Fitness in Thomasville, North Carolina.
                    Before this however I achieved a BS in History from Western Carolina University and worked as a
                    librarian in Davidson County for five years.
                    <br>
                    During my time at the library I had some exposure to front end development and some basic
                    troubleshooting but I believe the best benefit will come from my ability to google just about
                    anything.
                    Before leaving the library I was almost through my masters degreen in library science but decided to
                    stop that pursuit to take over and run a gym which had become a second home. While fulfilling it was
                    a
                    stuggle to manage this during a global pandemic which required me to shut down for several months
                    and I
                    am not looking for something that will allow my family a little more stability.
                    Recently selling the original location, my wife and I will continue to the run Chair City while I
                    progress in the software world.
