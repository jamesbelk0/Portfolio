        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is James Belk and I am just starting my coding career. I currently run a gym called Chair City Fitness in Thomasville, North Carolina. <br>
            Before this however I achieved a BS in History from Western Carolina University and worked as a librarian in Davidson County for five years. 
            <br>
            <br>
            During my time at the library I had some exposure to front end development and some basic troubleshooting but I believe the best benefit will come from my ability to google just about anything.
            Before leaving the library I was almost through my masters degreen in library science but decided to stop that pursuit to take over and run a gym which had become a second home. While fulfilling it was a stuggle to manage this during a global pandemic which required me to shut down for several months and I am not looking for something that will allow my family a little more stability.
            Recently selling the original location, my wife and I will continue to the run Chair City while I progress in the software world.
